# pachde-CHEM

CHEM (**C**ontrol the **H**aken **E**agan **M**atrix) is the successor to #d **HC One**.
Haken EaganMatrix firmware version 10.40 added many features and improvements to the MIDI protocol.
The changes are big enough to warrant a redesign of the modularization and user interface, hence a new plugin.

> I dream of make standalone versions with responsive touch controls suitable for live performance available for the major platforms with touch support, such as iOS, Android, and Windows. This requires an investment in $$ for the hardware, tools, and licensing. Any donations you make go towards funding these prerequisites.
